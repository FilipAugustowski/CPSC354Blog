Over the past week in Programming Languages we have learned about Abstract Reduction Systems (ARS) using Lambda Calculus as the model of rules to abstract. We learned that 
ARSs that are confluent and terminating are sound abstract models for an algorithm or a programming language. At this point, we have coded a calculator that has an interpreter 
thus making it easier for humans to use/read and it perserves readability for our machine. Now, the discrete mathematics that comes with an ARS seems to make sense to me, but 
I wanted to explore how this will help us with coding in and of itself.
