# Background

To be honest this is not my first Programming Languages course. Two semesters ago I studied abroad in Korea and took Korean computer science courses that were taught in English.  
For the most part the lecture was done in English, however any questions that were asked were usually answered in Korean. I had to learn most things on my own and could not 
depend on many others since I only knew 5 words of Korean. The other exchange students gave up in a few weeks and the korean students seemed to stick to themselves.

The language we used was called **O'Caml** and since the language was so obscure it was hard to find any sort of videos to work from. Oddly enough, it was quite normal for more than half the class to fail the course by the end of the semester and I was in that group. I however stuck around until the final.  

It took time, but I did well to figure out how to do a lot of the mathematical functions that we were given at the start of the course. Similar to our course here at Chapman we were given a type definition of natural numbers and were asked to create functions like *GCD*, *simple integrals*, *fast exponentiation*, *sigma of functions*, *zipper on lists* and other odd ones. Soon I started to lose my touch with the course as we entered more theoretical and confusing concepts. More specifically it took me a while to figure out how the caluclator/"eval exp" idea worked. Once I did figure that out however I found that for the first time recursion was quite interesting in that a large number of different functions can be funneled into a "calculator" that is self contained. For the intial calculator I actually used a lot of the notes from the Discrete Mathematics
course that I had taken at Chapman a semester before with Dr. Moshier. I think what really ended up pushing me to the end of the course was the fact that I could connect concepts that I learned from another part of the globe; there was a certain pride involved I am sure.

Anways, I found that it was very interesting that the building blocks of programming languages are really similar to the building blocks of our own number system. It soldified this idea that simple counting and addition is not as simple as one would think. In fact the rules that govern simple counting seem to govern the rest of the real world. 

If I were to compare my start with O'Caml to my start with Haskell I would say they were quite different experiences. With O'Caml I was given an account to a website called 
TryML. One will not be able to look to deeply without an account, but to get a general idea of how it was structured here is a link: https://tryml.korea.ac.kr/index.php#. 
Basically this is  an online terminal where one can write code and save it on the website. Each assignment was assigned through this website and I felt that it really helped my 
organization and you did not need any special download thus there were no Mac or Windows issues. Looking back on it now this really streamlined what we do in this course with 
github in that one just writes code on their account and all of the students work was organized in a way so that the professor and TA's had easy access. Thus when starting to use O'Caml, I found it very easy, however this soon changed as the course progressed. 

On the other hand I found that Haskell was a bit more difficult to get downloaded, especially when downloading BNFC since I am on a windows machine. Although I had to deal with a fair amount of trial and error to get things downloaded right, I found that Haskell had a lot more coverage and explanation online which consistently helped answer questions I had as a result of lecture. Furthermore, in my Korean programming languages course it seemed like it was every man for himself, but here the discussion form helps to juxtapose my previous experience. 

If I were to make a recommendation on how to help the class it would be to use something like tryml. I think Github is an insanley useful and necessary to learn tool, but for organization's sake, the speed at which you can check student progress, the speed at which you can start the course (no download issues), and the ability to easily contain practice homework to full projects could improve the course. However, I think it is important to keep in mind that I do not know how something like BNFC could be added and used to tryml but at the very least when there is homework (the homework that is not graded) you can easily check who has done it and you can easily assign it.
